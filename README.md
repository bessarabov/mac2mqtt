# mac2mqtt

`mac2mqtt` is a program that allow viewing and controlling some aspects of computers running macOS via MQTT.

It publish to MQTT:

 * current volume
 * volume mute state
 * battery charge percent

You can send topics to:

 * change volume
 * mute/unmute
 * put computer to sleep
 * shutdown computer
 * turn off display

## Running

To run this program you need to put 2 files in a directory (`/Users/USERNAME/mac2mqtt/`):

    mac2mqtt
    mac2mqtt.yaml

Edit `mac2mqtt.yaml` (the sample file is in this repository), make binary executable (`chmod +x mac2mqtt`) and run `./mac2mqtt`:

    $ ./mac2mqtt
    2021/04/12 10:37:28 Started
    2021/04/12 10:37:29 Connected to MQTT
    2021/04/12 10:37:29 Sending 'true' to topic: mac2mqtt/bessarabov-osx/status/alive

## Running in the background

You need `mac2mqtt.yaml` and `mac2mqtt` to be placed in the directory `/Users/USERNAME/mac2mqtt/`,
then you need to create file `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.bessarabov.mac2mqtt.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>com.bessarabov.mac2mqtt</string>
        <key>Program</key>
        <string>/Users/USERNAME/mac2mqtt/mac2mqtt</string>
        <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
        <string>/Users/USERNAME/mac2mqtt/</string>
        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true/>
        <key>KeepAlive</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>
</plist>
```

And run:

    launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.bessarabov.mac2mqtt.plist

(To stop you need to run `launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.bessarabov.mac2mqtt.plist`)

## MQTT topics structure

Program is working with several MQTT topics. All topix are prefixed with `mac2mqtt` + `COMPUTER_NAME`.
For examaple, topic with current volume on my machine is `mac2mqtt/bessarabov-osx/status/volume`

`mac2mqtt` send info to the topics `mac2mqtt/COMPUTER_NAME/status/#` and listen for commands in topics
`mac2mqtt/COMPUTER_NAME/command/#`.

### PREFIX + `/status/alive`

There can be `true` of `false` in this topic. If `mac2mqtt` is connected to MQTT server there is `true`.
If `mac2mqtt` is disconnected from MQTT there is `false`. This is the standard MQTT thing called Last Will and Testament.

### PREFIX + `/status/volume`

The value is the numbers from 0 (inclusive) to 100 (inclusive). The current volume of computer.

The value of this topic is updated every 2 seconds.

### PREFIX + `/status/mute`

There can be `true` of `false` in this topic. `true` means that the computer volume is muted (no sound),
`false` means that it is not multed.

### PREFIX + `/status/battery`

The value is the nuber up to 100. The charge percent of the battery.

The value of this topic is updated every 60 seconds.

### PREFIX + `/command/volume`

You can send integer numberf from 0 (inclusive) to 100 (inclusive) to this topic. It will set the volume on the computer.

### PREFIX + `/command/mute`

You can send `true` of `false` to this topic. When you send `true` the computer is muted. When you send `false` the computer
is unmuted.

### PREFIX + `/command/input_volume`

You can send integer numberf from 0 (inclusive) to 100 (inclusive) to this topic. It will set the input volume (usually the microphone) on the computer.

### PREFIX + `/command/sleep`

You can send string `sleep` to this topic. It will put computer to sleep mode. Sending some other value will do nothing.

### PREFIX + `/command/shutdown`

You can send string `shutdown` to this topic. It will try to shutdown the computer. The way it is done depends on
the user who run the program. If the program is run by `root` the computer will shutdown, but if it is run by ordinary user
the computer will not shut down if there is other user who logged in.

Sending some other value but `shutdown` will do nothing.

### PREFIX + `/command/displaysleep`

You can send string `displaysleep` to this topic. It will turn off display. Sending some other value will do nothing.

### PREFIX + `/command/displaywake`

You can send string `displaywake` to this topic. It will turn on display. Sending some other value will do nothing.

### PREFIX + `/command/displaylock`

You can send the string `displaylock` to this topic to lock the screen.
You can also send the string `displaylock_sleep` to this topic to not only lock the screen but also put the computer to sleep.
Sending some other value will do nothing.

### PREFIX + `/command/runshortcut`

You can send the name of a shortcut to this topic. It will run this shortcut in the Shortcuts app.

## Building

To build this program yourself, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure you have installed go, for example with `brew install go`
3. Install its dependencies with `go install`
4. Build with `go build mac2mqtt.go`

It outputs a file `mac2mqtt`. Make the binary executable (`chmod +x mac2mqtt`) and run `./mac2mqtt`.
